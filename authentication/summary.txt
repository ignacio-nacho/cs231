Part 2
Passwords cracked: 1133
Total time: 1106.94s
Number of hashes computed: 622788826
Passwords cracked per number of hashes computed: 0.000001819
Time per password cracked: 0.9769

Factor by which your time per password lengthened, and why:
2185.459 because we have 3 orders of magnitude more hashes to compute due to the presence of the salt.
This was only cracking the passwords with one word, cracking the passwords with two words would've taken longer than the time we have availabe before the assignment due date.
