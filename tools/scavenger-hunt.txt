Answers:

1) 137.22.172.63 (Bonus: N/A; Are you able to do this if you don't have both connections active?) 

2) nslookup `hostname`

3) One can provide nslookup with an address to see the host name. (i.e. nslookup 137.22.172.63) 

4) A simple way of doing this seems to involve using Apache. First I would copy the file to /var/www/html/ (cp file.txt /var/www/html/ and then start the apache service (service apache2 start). Then I could access the file through the browser by visiting the url (http://MY_KALI_IP/file.txt) or through the cli using the curl or wget command. (curl http://MY_KALI_IP/file.txt > file.txt) 

5) sudo lsof -nP -iTCP:80 -sTCP:LISTEN (This command would be for looking specifically at port 80. Additionally, the use of sudo allows us to see the host even if it is the root user. 

6) lsof -nP -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN (This command would display all of the listening TCP ports for the current host. One could add the sudo command to show all of the hosts including root) 

7) curl -o website https://example.com/ (Here the output from example.com would be saved in a file named website) 

8) curl -I https://example.com/
