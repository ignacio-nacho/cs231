g = 17 
p = 61

A = 46
B = 5

The shared secret (k) between the two: k = 12. Found by: 17^(14*26) mod 61 = 12. I could've found k after finding only one secret number by performing: 5^14 mod 61 = 12 or 46^26 mod 61 = 12. 

I found the secret by finding a and b (the secret number each of them chose to make A and B), though it was not necessary to find both, only one (a or b) would be sufficient to crack their encryption. I found a and b by finding the exponent each of them used to create the number they sent. Doing so was simple enough due to the small value of p. I knew that each of their secret numbers had to be less than p, so I used trial and error to find that 17^14 mod 61 = 46 and 17^26 mod 61 = 5. This would've been much harder to do with a larger p value because it would increase the amount of possibilities for their secret numbers.

Encrypted Message: Dear Bob, Check this out. https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2015/12/e-mail_tracking_1.html Yikes! Your friend, Alice

In order to crack the encryption, I first checked to see if there were repeating numbers to ensure that each letter was encrypted the same way and that there wasn't anything such as a block cipher used. Next, I continued with the assumption that you would be encrypting ASCII values of the letters so I used Bob's public key to encrypt the vowels, using their ASCII values. For example, a: 97^31 mod 4661. Once I had encrpyted the vowels I found their matching values in the message and replaced them. I continued to do this with commonly used consonants until I could verify that what I was uncovering was a coherent message (by seeing patterns such as Bob and Alice). I continued by filling in letters I believed belonged to create certain words, using the encryption algorithm (x^31 mod 4661) to double-check my guesses with their ASCII values. After seeing https and the repitition of w's, I assumed there were symbols in the message and proceeded to repeat the same process on the symbols in the message. 

However, after completing this (and some reflection) I realized that we were given everything necessary to determine Bob's secret key (assuming n was the same, I am referring to d). This is because we are given n = 4661 and we know that n is composed of two prime numbers. Since n is relatively small, I was able to deduce that p and q were 59 and 79. Subsequently, I could've used trial and error to determine d (Bob's secret key, assuming n is the same) by finding the x such that 31*x mod 4661 = 1. Since I had already cracked the encryption, I didn't complete this step, but it was a matter of trial and error. With a larger n, it would've been much more difficult to determine the value of p and q because there would be so many different possiblities. Additionally, even if I were able to determine p and q with a larger n, the next step would also be much more difficult (if not impossible) because increasing n would also drastically increase the number of potential values for d.
